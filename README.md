The company has decided to crowdsale their PupperCoin (PUP) token in order to help fund the network development.

The terms of the crowdsale are:

* The crowdsale will run for 24 weeks (for testing purposes we will use Close to be now + 15 min).

* The maximum amount to be raised is 300 ETH.

* The crowdsale will allow users to send ETH and get back PUP (PupperCoin).

* This contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.

* The crowdsale will allow refunds if the crowdsale is successful and goal has been met.

* The contract will be tested on the local Ganache blockchin and later on Kovan or Ropsten test networks.
